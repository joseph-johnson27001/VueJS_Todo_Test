# vuex-broken-todo

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

## Problem
The project is missing functionality that needs to be completed. 
1. Add the ability to be able to toggle the completed state of the todo.
2. The create todo form, currently doesn't add a todo. Investigate and fix
